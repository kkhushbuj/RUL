Runs ONCE for the whole project, not per-engine. It researches real published
work on jet-engine / C-MAPSS RUL prediction and produces a structured
knowledge base: which sensors are reported as most predictive, and what
degradation patterns typically precede failure. The Synthesis Agent later
diffs each engine's SHAP result against this knowledge base.

condition) and rarely reported as predictive — be suspicious of any source claiming high \
